# Object-Early vs Object-Late
This is the research data discussed in the journal article _Object-Early versus Object-Late: Perspectives on Concept Acquisition in Undergraduate Software Engineering Courses_. This article compares methods of introducing Object-Oriented paradigms while teaching undergraduate programming language courses. The current version of the ontology is available in the main branch. It is referred to in the article as Version 5.

Teaching Object-Oriented programming is a core element of undergraduate software engineering courses. However, the literature suggests that in the past, first-year failure rates were often woefully high. This article explores the order of presentation of programming language concepts, including object-orientation. It presents case studies from three institutions. Using a custom ontology, the findings are considered with reference to issues raised in both current and historical literature that examine concept acquisition in this context.
